% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

\numberofauthors{1}

% You can go ahead and credit any number of authors here,
% e.g. one 'row of three' or two rows (consisting of one row of three
% and a second row of one, two or three).
%
% The command \alignauthor (no curly braces needed) should
% precede each author name, affiliation/snail-mail address and
% e-mail address. Additionally, tag each line of
% affiliation/address with \affaddr, and tag the
% e-mail address with \email.

% Note, I am overriding affaddr and email commands because I don't like the
% font sizes used.

\begin{abstract}
  We are on the threshold of a transformative change in the basic
  architecture of high performance computing.  The use of accelerator
  processors, characterized by large core counts, shared but asymetric
  memory, and heavy thread loading, is quickly becoming the norm in high
  performance computing.  These accelerators represent siginficant
  challenges in updating our existing base of software.  An intrinsic
  problem with this transition is a fundamental programming shift from
  message passing processes to much more fine thread scheduling with memory
  sharing.  Another problem is the lack of stability in accelerator
  implementation; processor and compiler technology is currently changing
  rapidly.  In this paper we describe our approach to address these two
  immediate problems with respect to scientific analysis and visualization
  algorithms.  Our approach to accelerator programming forms the basis of
  the Dax toolkit, a framework to build data analysis and visualization
  algorithms applicable to exascale computing.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:Introduction}

Whereas supercomputers throughout the terascale era were almost
unilaterally built from general purpose CPU processors on distributed
memory nodes with a message passing interface, with petascale computing we
are seeing the emerging use of accelerators to meet the execution and
computation requirements of modern leadership-class facilities.
