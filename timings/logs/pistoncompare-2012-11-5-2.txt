Timings from pistoncompare run on my mac desktop: dual Quad-Core Intel
Xeon processors (8 cores total) and 32 GB of system memory.  NVIDIA Quadro
4000 with 2 GB of memory.  Snow Leopard version 10.6.8.

pistoncompare SHA: ee07c16f9c85a441d8ac15eaef5c670146ba8abb
Dax SHA: 83037a4a39efdbde93eadfe9aa7a059ab1158805
Thrust version: 1.5.2
CUDA version: 4.2
PISTON version: 0.4, modified

The PISTON code for these runs has been modified to produce results
isomorphic with Dax.  The feature of producing only external cells is
removed, and instead of producing quads of faces with normals produces a
single hexahedron for each passed cell.

The Dax implementation has also changed slightly.  Some unnecessary
computation has been removed from the classify.  The runs are slightly
faster.  The difference is minimal, but these values should be used for the
the Dax timings.
