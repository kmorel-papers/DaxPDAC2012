Timings from thresholdexample run on my mac desktop: dual Quad-Core Intel
Xeon processors (8 cores total) and 32 GB of system memory.  NVIDIA Quadro
4000 with 2 GB of memory.  Snow Leopard version 10.6.8.

thresholdexample SHA: 6adbc40270fef96bca006fd5291095c8eab286cf
Dax SHA: 110fa7713e5b20837d13833bcd6c1c412afd5569
Thrust version: 1.5.2
CUDA version: 4.2
TBB version: 4.1-20120718

The exceptions are the VTK timings, which were taken with the Kitware
binary distribution of ParaView 3.14.1.  The ParaView CycleThreshold.py
script was used to execute 20 runs, the log (pv_log-2012-11-05.txt) was
saved, and the times were hard copied into timings-2012-11-05.csv (and
then later to timings-2012-11-20.csv).

This timings are a redo of those in timings-2012-11-05.csv.  Added to the
computation is the compaction of the scalar array.  This is to make the
Dax computation equivalent to the VTK computation, which also compacts the
scalar array.
