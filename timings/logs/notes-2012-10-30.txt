Timings from thresholdexample run on my mac desktop: dual Quad-Core Intel
Xeon processors (8 cores total) and 32 GB of system memory.  NVIDIA Quadro
4000 with 2 GB of memory.  Snow Leopard version 10.6.8.

Dax SHA: a07dcc368ac54c4ec6c9e2aee08d991ebb65777c
Thrust version: 1.5.2
CUDA version: 4.2
TBB version: 4.1-20120718

The exceptions are the VTK timings, which were taken with the Kitware
binary distribution of ParaView 3.14.1.  The ParaView CycleThreshold.py
script was used to execute 20 runs, the log (pv_log-2012-10-30.txt) was
saved, and the times were had copied into timings-2012-10-30.csv.

As I observe the times, I realize there is an inconsistency with the VTK
times.  The first trial in the VTK times does not correspond to the first
time the operation was run in that process.  Thus, and library
"initialization" that occurs in the other series is not recorded in the VTK
timings.
