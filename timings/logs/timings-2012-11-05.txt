Timings from thresholdexample run on my mac desktop: dual Quad-Core Intel
Xeon processors (8 cores total) and 32 GB of system memory.  NVIDIA Quadro
4000 with 2 GB of memory.  Snow Leopard version 10.6.8.

thresholdexample SHA: 14b6c609ac1156ebe00eadd271f79e8630b88497
Dax SHA: 83037a4a39efdbde93eadfe9aa7a059ab1158805
Thrust version: 1.5.2
CUDA version: 4.2
TBB version: 4.1-20120718

The exceptions are the VTK timings, which were taken with the Kitware
binary distribution of ParaView 3.14.1.  The ParaView CycleThreshold.py
script was used to execute 20 runs, the log (pv_log-2012-11-05.txt) was
saved, and the times were had copied into timings-2012-11-05.csv.

These timings are similar to the previous ones run but now incorporate some
fixes to Dax efficiency.  Also, the VTK timings are re-run to make the
first run do any initialization.  (It did not make a difference.)
