This directory contains a simple example to run timings that were presented
in the paper "Flexible Analysis Software for Emerging Architectures"
(Figure 5).  The program is configured with CMake.

In the build directory, a script named runtests.sh will be placed, which
provides a convienient way to run through all the tests that were performed
for the paper.
